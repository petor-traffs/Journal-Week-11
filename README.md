# Journal-Week-11

## What I learned: December 7- December 11 edition

Alright, here we go, week number 11! This week came with the TBW of Encora, and wow! I don’t know how to express it, so here’s nothing...I’ve never experienced anything like this in a place of work! I mean, in my career, because of the tense environment of a hospital, normally you don’t have these kinds of “activities”. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I didn’t like working there, it’s just that there’s normally no time to get your group of work together, so the fact that I was able to be in this week was a pleasant feeling for me. You can see why Nearsoft by Encora is one of the selected companies that have won a prize for “best company to work in”. I just wanted to get that out of my chest, in hopes that maybe one day, if I’m not in Encora, I’ll be able to work in a company that genuinely worries for their employees.

With that out of the way, let’s go to the learning stuff! I can’t recall if I said this in the last entry, but let’s just say that my plan with the issues didn’t go very well. After talking with different teammates and the ones in charge of the Academy, we came to the conclusion to make a change of focus in this phase, so I’ve been reading and investigating concepts from 2 subjects: the bases in programming and Data Science. With the first one I’ve been mostly watching videos and checking on lists of the main subjects. For the Data Science one, I’ve been following the recommendations that were given to me. I’ve been checking on jobs posted, and see what subjects I should know to be in a Data Science job.

First, let’s go for the bases in programming. Many things that I watched are, in my opinion, very basic, so I don’t think it would be a good idea to write it down. The one part that I never heard of was the 4 pillars of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). First….what’s that?? OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

Having said that, we now go to the pillars! There are four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming:
* Encapsulation
Encapsulation is accomplished when each object maintains a private state, inside a class. Other objects can not access this state directly, instead, they can only invoke a list of public functions. The object manages its own state via these functions and no other class can alter it unless explicitly allowed. In order to communicate with the object, you will need to utilize the methods provided.

* Abstraction
Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object. Suppose you want to create a dating application and you are asked to collect all the information about your users. You might receive the following data from your user: Full name, address, phone number, favorite food, favorite movie, hobbies, tax information, social security number, credit score. This amount of data is great however not all of it is required to create a dating profile. You only need to select the information that is pertinent to your dating application from that pool.

* Inheritance
Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, reusability is a major advantage. You can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. 

* Polymorphism
Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types. This being said, each child sub-class keeps its own functions/methods as they are.

Now, for the Data Science subjects! It’s a very big, and maybe complex, subject. It has many other subjects and concepts that combine to understand it. One of the main ones (or that I investigated) are the Machine Learning algorithms. They are divided into three categories, with the first two being the most common:

* Supervised learning
These algorithms have prior learning incorporated in them and are based on a tag system associated with data that allow them to make decisions or make predictions. 
* Unsupervised learning
These algorithms do not have previous knowledge. They face data chaos with the objective of finding patterns. 

* Reinforced learning 
Its objective is for an algorithm to learn from its own experience. In other words, it will be able to make the best decision in different situations according to a trial and error process in which the correct decisions are awarded.

Along with all of these concepts, it’s clear that I need to use the tools for DS (that is Python), so I’m currently taking a Python course, from zero. Once I finish that, I’ll be taking the course of Machine Learning algorithms in Data Science (in Python). The road is long, but let’s just take one step at a time, constantly.

I believe that's it from me, if you have any questions, let me know!
